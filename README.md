# Adgistics.Acl #

This is a port/rewrite of the Zend Framework's 2 ACL library into a C# library with a similar declarative format of code and usage.

Feel free to read their documentation to get a good intial understanding of how you would use an ACL library: https://github.com/zendframework/Component_ZendPermissionsAcl
